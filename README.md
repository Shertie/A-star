# A* algorythm

## What's inside?

This tiny repo includes implementation of A* algorythm with visualization. Grid for it is inside the 'grid.txt' file. Start and goal is set inside python code, but walls are recognized as '5' and free spaces as '0'. 
If start/end point is set inside wall or the path is blocked, proper message will be shown in console.

## What's that for?

The algorythm was implemented for Computer Science Studies purpose and has been approved by my professor.

## Docs

I see no reason for describing how this program works as it is being described inside the code with comments.
